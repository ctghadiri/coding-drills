# Google Fu

## Tips & Tricks

* In programming, the tried and true method of finding exactly what you want, is to search the _topic_ followed by the name of the language.
    * Example - I don't quite remember how to do a for loop in javascript. Let's google: `for loops javascript`
* Error messages are your friend. If you are unable to debug an error message, google the entire thing!
* Ask google, like you'd ask a real person! Google's search algorithms have advanced quite a bit and can recongize speech patterns.
    * Example - I want to change the text of an HTML element. Let's google: `how to change text of html in javascript`
* There are many search operators that most developers don't know about that can help limit or expand the scope of your search. A complete list of operators and methods can be found [here](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) or... you can google them!

### Instructions

* Create a new markdown files to keep track of what you search
* Each prompt will give you a situation that needs to be addressed or fixed. What would you search to remedy these prompts?
* Write down your search queries for each prompt and pick a few of the returned search results after scanning them
